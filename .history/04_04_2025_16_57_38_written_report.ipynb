    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pacific Laboratory for [Artificial Intelligence (PLAI)](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/), a research group at UBC’s Computer Science department led by [Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/), is interested in understanding which characteristics and behaviours in a video game player are most predictive of game newsletter subscription for Minecraft. Group 6 poses the question of whether age (`Age`), player's experience (`experience`), and played hours (`played_hours`) are reliable predictors for subscription status (`subscribe`) in the `players.csv` file.  While we will be explicitly using those three mentioned variables, there are also `gender`, `name`, and `hashedEmail` which make up the *7* columns and *196* rows of `players.csv`. Below is a description of the *7* variables.  \n",

    "### METHODS USED\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore whether a Minecraft player’s age, experience level, and hours played could predict whether they subscribe to the game’s newsletter, we used a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by importing the dataset `players.csv`, which contains *196* observations and *7* variables, including the target variable `subscribe`. Only the relevant predictor variables - `age`, `played_hours`, and `experience`, were selected for analysis. We removed entries with missing values and reformatted variable types as needed, converting categorical values such as experience into an ordered factor ranked from lowest to highest as follows: \"Beginner\", \"Amateur\", \"Regular\", \"Veteran\", \"Pro\". Irrelevant identifiers such as name and hashedEmail were excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building our model, we took a closer look at the data to understand the general trends. We noticed that most players were around *20* years old, with the youngest being *8* and the oldest *50*. The time spent playing Minecraft varied a lot, some players had barely played at all, while one had logged over *220* hours. This step helped us understand the range and behavior of our predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "To train and test our model fairly, we split the data into two parts: one for training the model and one for testing how well it performs. We used a method called cross-validation to figure out how many neighbours the KNN model should consider when making a prediction. This helped us find the best version of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluating the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "After building the model, we tested it on the unseen portion of the data to see how accurate it was. We found that our model could correctly predict whether a player subscribed about ***72.5%*** of the time. While the accuracy was solid, we also noticed that the model did not perform significantly better than chance in terms of consistency, likely because the characteristics of subscribed and unsubscribed players were quite similar."

However, the plot yielded no obvious trends among the variables—whether or not a player is subscribed to the newsletter is evenly distributed between the variables. It can be observed that there is a weak negative correlation between variable `Age` and `played_hours` but the results for subcription and experience level is a little more ambiguous. \n",
    "\n",

    "Overall, by plotting each predictor individually, it can be determined that players who play more hours of the game and who are younger are more likely to subscribe to the newsletter, making the variables played_hours and age somewhat useful predictors of subscribe. Experience on the other hand, yielded no relationship with subscription suggesting that it is not a good predictor for subscription. This helps explain why our KNN classification model has an accuracy of about ***72.5%***—not all the predictors had strong relationships with Subscribe. \n"

    "The implication of these results could be useful for marketing strategies. By understanding what type of players are more likely to subscribe to the newsletter, allows the content of the newsletter to be better tailored for its audience. Additionally, with this information, different marketing strategies would be employed to increase subscription rates for groups who are less likely to subscribe. \n",

    "Based on our analysis, it can be understood that every recorded player ages *8-13* are subscribed to the newsletter with teens having the highest age group ratio of doing so. Those that play over *5* hours are almost always likely to subscribe to the newsletter as well. This communicates that younger players and those with more time to play Minecraft are more likely to subscribe to the newletter. \n"
