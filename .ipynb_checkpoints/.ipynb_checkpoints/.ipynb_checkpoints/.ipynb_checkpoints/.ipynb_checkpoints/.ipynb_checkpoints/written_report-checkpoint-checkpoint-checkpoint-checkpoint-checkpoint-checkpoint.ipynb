    "The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) [link their research page], a research group at UBCâ€™s Computer Science department led by Frank Wood [link his page], is interested in understanding which characteristics and behaviours in a video game player are most predictive of game newsletter subscription for Minecraft. Group 6 poses the question of whether age (`Age`) and played hours (`played_hours`) are reliable predictors for subscription status (`subscribe`) in the players.csv file.  While we will be explicitly using those three explicitly mentioned variables, there is also `gender`, `name`, `experience`, and `hashedEmail` which make up the 7 columns and 196 rows of `players.csv`. Below is a description of the 7 variables.  \n",

    "Based on data exploration the mean played hours of the players is 5.8 hours, with a player reaching 223.1 hour and some not even reaching 1 full hour. The mean age of the 196 recorded players is 20, the oldest being 50 and the youngest being 8 years old.  "
